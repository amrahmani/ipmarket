IPMARKET â€” Upgraded site with chatbot, summarizer & recommender
=================================================================

This package upgrades the previous static site with three client-side features:
1) Chatbot: keyword-matching assistant with short session memory (no server).
2) Listing summarizer: "Generate improved AI summary" button on listing pages (mock).
3) Recommender: records user interests (localStorage) and shows recommended listings.

Deploy as before (GitHub Pages). The site is fully static and safe to host on GitHub Pages.
